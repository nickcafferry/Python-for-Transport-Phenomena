Python4All
===========

These threes series on Channel 9 and YouTube are designed to help get you up to speed on Python. If you're a beginning developer looking to add Python to your quiver of languages, or trying to get started on a data science or web project which uses Python, these videos are here to help show you the foundations necessary to walk through a tutorial or other quick start.

We do assume you are familiar with another programming language, and some core programming concepts. For example, we highlight the syntax for boolean expressions and creating classes, but we don't dig into what a `boolean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type>`_ is or `object oriented design <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design>`_. We show you how to perform the tasks you're familiar with in other languages in Python.

What you'll learn
-----------------
- The basics of Python
- Common syntax
- Popular packages

Prerequisites
----------------

- Light experience with another programming language, such as `JavaScript <https://www.edx.org/course/javascript-introduction>`_, `Java <https://www.java.com>`_ or `C# <https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/>`_
- `An understanding of Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started>`_

Courses
------------

Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Python for beginners <https://aka.ms/pythonbeginnerseries>`_ is the perfect starting location for getting started. No Python experience is required! We'll show you how to set up `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_ as your code editor, and start creating Python code. You'll see how to manage create, structure and run your code, how to manage packages, and even make `REST calls <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_.

Dig a little deeper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`More Python for beginners <https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/More-Python-for-Beginners>`_ digs deeper into Python syntax. You'll explore how to create classes and mixins in Python, how to work with the file system, and introduce `async/await`. This is the perfect next step if you're looking to see a bit more of what Python can do.

Peek at data science tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Even more Python for beginners <https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Even-More-Python-for-Beginners-Data-Tools>`_ is a practical exploration of a couple of the most common packages and tools you'll use when working with data and machine learning. While we won't dig into why you choose particular machine learning models (that's another course), you will get hands on with Jupyter Notebooks, and create and test models using scikit-learn and pandas.

Next steps
^^^^^^^^^^

As the goal of these courses is to help get you up to speed on Python so you can work through a quick start. The next step after completing the videos is to follow a tutorial! Here's a few of our favorites:

- `Quickstart: Detect faces in an image using the Face REST API and Python <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/QuickStarts/Python?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_
- `Quickstart: Analyze a local image using the Computer Vision REST API and Python <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/quickstarts/python-disk?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_
- `Quickstart: Using the Python REST API to call the Text Analytics Cognitive Service <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/Text-Analytics/quickstarts/python?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_
- `Tutorial: Build a Flask app with Azure Cognitive Services <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/tutorial-build-flask-app-translation-synthesis?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_
- `Flask tutorial in Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_
- `Django tutorial in Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_
- `Predict flight delays by creating a machine learning model in Python <https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/predict-flight-delays-with-python?WT.mc_id=python-c9-niner>`_

Programming with Python
--------------------------

Over the course of a set of videos we're going to show you the ropes of Python development. Let's start by chatting through what we're going to cover, and if this series is right for you.
