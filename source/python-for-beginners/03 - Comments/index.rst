Comments
========

Comments start with a hash character (#) and allow you to document your code. Comments are ignored when code is executed.

- `Comments <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html?highlight=comment>`_

A comment starts with a hash character (#) that is not part of a string literal, and ends at the end of the physical line. A comment signifies the end of the logical line unless the implicit line joining rules are invoked. Comments are ignored by the syntax.

How do we get started?
======================

Now that we know about Python, the next question is, how do we get started? Well, the first thing that we're going to need is somewhere for Python to run. Python is an interpreted language, so you will need a runtime in which Python can execute. Fortunately, all that you need to do is head on over to Python.org/downloads and you can go ahead and grab it from there.
